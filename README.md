# pomorodo_timer_clock
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.[1] The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student. This program is built using Python programming language 

This program has a GUI which has been built using tkinter module.

You can use this application to manage your time well.You just have to click the start button and then you will start a timer for 25 mins, after which break time of 5 mins will be activated. This continues for about 5 cycles. The number of ticks represent the no of cycles you have gone through.Reset Button resets the timer

HOW_TO_USE:
1.Decide on the task to be done.
2.Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes).[1]
3.Work on the task.
4.End work when the timer rings and put a checkmark on a piece of paper.[5]
5.If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (3–5 minutes) and then return to step 2; otherwise continue to step 6.
6.After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15–30 minutes), reset your checkmark count to zero, then go to step 1.

# pomorodo_timer_clock
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.[1] The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student. This program is built using Python programming language 

This program has a GUI which has been built using tkinter module.

You can use this application to manage your time well.You just have to click the start button and then you will start a timer for 25 mins, after which break time of 5 mins will be activated. This continues for about 5 cycles. The number of ticks represent the no of cycles you have gone through.
